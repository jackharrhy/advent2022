# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) solutions

Trying my best, to complete in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), using [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/), like my [previous years solutions](https://github.com/jackharrhy/advent2021).

Doing some writeups over here about these solutions, and the solutions of others: https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/aoc/2022/
